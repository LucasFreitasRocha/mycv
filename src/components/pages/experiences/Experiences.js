                  Currently, I am integrated into the cards team, collaborating on Banco Original's products in partnership with PicPay. We are focused on migrating Original's infrastructure services to PicPay, aiming to optimize and enhance the customer experience on the PicPay app.
                  Recently, I participated in a crucial project for the financial adjustment of clients with overdue invoices, with potential for minimum settlement. I used technologies such as Spring Boot, Batch, Kafka, and MongoDB to develop the solution.
                  Previously, I contributed to the project for creating the CADOC 3050 file, using Spring Batch and AWS S3. The main challenge of this project was dealing with a large volume of data and the need for correct sorting of information by date, converting positional TXT files into XML according to the specified layout.
                  My first project in the team involved migrating invoice files to AWS S3 and developing a new query API. Previously, these invoices were stored in the GED system, which I had expertise in because it was the first team I joined. I used Spring Batch to batch-process the files, rename them according to the metadata and new business rules, and then upload them to the S3 bucket. At the end of the process, the team is notified via Slack.
                  All projects in the team are developed using Spring (Boot and Batch), Maven is used for build management, and Oracle DB and MongoDB are used for the database.

                  My time in the crypto team was short due to the discontinuation of the product in the company, but I made contributions to the price alert feature, which notifies about price variations in cryptocurrencies, and we were working on the target price feature for buying and selling cryptocurrencies.
                  Most projects were written with Spring Boot and used Gradle for build management. Some projects used Quarkus and Maven for build management.

                  This is the team where I started in the company and grew as a professional. In this team, I participated in several projects which I will list, but the main one was the GED project, which I will explain further.
                  Harpia Project: This project was developed in Go and aims to validate/evaluate new clients. The feature I contributed to was the validation/evaluation for new company collaborators, and it integrates with GreenHouse.
                  QSBO Project: This project is responsible for breaking bank secrecy in case of judicial measures. My contribution to this project was in developing a new API (Spring Boot) to facilitate communication between PicPay and Original.
                  FISCA Project:
                  This project is responsible for generating the client's income statement according to the calendar year. My part in this project was developing Spring Batch to read the positional TXT file and save information in the database. In addition to the batch, an API (Spring Boot) was created to read client information to generate the PDF. PDF generation is done using Jasper.
                  GED Project:
                  This project is responsible for managing files in the company in general:
                  - Evolution and maintenance of the document management system.
                  - I participated in migrating from the Oracle Documaker document creation system to Jasper.
                  - Migration from Oracle BPEL to Spring Batch for managing large volumes of data and integration with legacy systems in SOAP and Oracle WebLogic

                  As a Junior Analyst, I joined the company and made significant contributions to improving internal processes. I used IBM's BPM tool to optimize workflows and created new document templates using Oracle Documaker for the Electronic Document Management System (EDS).
                  In the EDS, I was responsible for enhancing document search methods, using metadata for more efficient searches and facilitating the inclusion of new files.
                  Additionally, I actively participated in a project called ANTIV, whose objective was to evaluate documents received from new clients for viruses and malware, ensuring the security of company data.
