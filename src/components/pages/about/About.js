          <p>
            I am a Bachelor of Information Systems and work as a Systems Analyst specializing in Back-End development. Currently, I am immersed in the Spring Boot ecosystem (Java), where I gained experience during my journey at Candido Mendes University and now continue my development at Banco Original.
            My professional journey includes web development, with a focus on Back-End. I had the privilege of making significant contributions to a company focused on digital certificates, actively participating in the creation of a new e-commerce platform and internal projects, using PHP and Vue.js.
